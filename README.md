**Pandas to PostgreSQL: Python Database Integration**

This project demonstrates how to integrate Python with PostgreSQL using Pandas and the psycopg2 library. It covers essential steps to automate the process of reading a CSV file and inserting the data into a PostgreSQL database.

**What This Project Covers**

1. Connecting to PostgreSQL using psycopg2
2. Creating a new PostgreSQL database from Python
3. Creating a table in PostgreSQL using Python
4. Reading and processing a CSV file using Pandas
5. Renaming columns to match the database schema
6. Inserting data from a Pandas DataFrame into a PostgreSQL table
7. Handling common Python and PostgreSQL errors
8. Verifying data after insertion


**Why This is Useful**

1. This kind of workflow is commonly required in real-world data roles, including:
2. Data Scientists: Useful for automating data ingestion into structured databases.
3. Data Analysts: Helps in maintaining and querying structured datasets for reporting.
4. Data Engineers: Forms the basis for ETL pipelines, especially when working with batch jobs or database integration tasks.


**Dataset Used**

A sample CSV file containing student data with fields like Student_ID, Name, Age, Gender, Course, and Marks.


**Key Learnings**

1. How to use autocommit for operations like creating databases

2. How to fix path errors in Windows while reading CSV files

3. How to handle dtype mismatch or pandas-related import issues
